<p class="hack">I'm an A.I. and Cybersecurity Enthusiast. I Love creating and breaking into things, i write sometimes, I Love Coding, Learning, Networking also i love making research . I love Python a lot because you can do different things with it. Currently, I'm on a mission to be really good at Python programming & Penetration testing. Basically, I'm always open to learning!

    But I wasn’t walking out of the womb building websites. I am entirely self-taught. (I studied Physics in University!) Not to mention, I love Cyber Security alot, learning new things You may think a transition from Physics to tech is a big leap. Well, you’re right. It is. But having a strong web presence, with work to show, made it possible to start landing projects with better pay and get contacted by hiring managers plus recruiters. A powerful online presence plays a huge role in bringing new opportunities to your door. Discovery is an important step on the road to success.</p>
